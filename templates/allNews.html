            <p class="element-article">And a horrible new Fishstick.  Fortnite's annual Halloween extravaganza is back for another year, and this time the battle royale has roped in a few more famous friends.   Remedy's very own Alan Wake will be available to buy as a skin later in the event, presumably timed alongside the launch of the long-awaited Alan Wake 2 (that's due on 27th October).    Jack Skellington from Tim Burton's The Nightmare Before Christmas is also joining Fortnite - I like that he also has his Santa Jack costume as well - alongside Halloween's Michael Myers.   On the Island itself, a smattering of changes: some new and returning weapons (including the Pumpkin Launcher and Witch's Broom), plus the return of Fortnite's fan-favourite Horde Rush mode, which lets you take down waves of Cube Monsters as part of a squad.   Oh, and there's a creepy new Fishstick variant named Bogstick, who looks like nightmare fuel.    Fortnite is also pushing on with its ongoing seasonal questline, which concerns a vampire mob boss named Kado Thorne taking over parts of the Island. Leaks suggest the coming weeks will see Thorne's time machine come into play - and the return of a familiar face from Fortnite's overall story - as this Chapter and Island map both head towards their year anniversary.  If you're keen to find out more about Alan Wake, our Bertie is talking to Remedy boss Sam Lake this week ahead of EGX 2023 - and you can submit your burning questions now.

A Daily SportsLine Betting Podcast  Vikings star Justin Jefferson left Sunday's game against the Chiefs in the fourth quarter with a hamstring injury and did not return. After much uncertainty surrounding the severity of the injury and how long he would be out, now we know -- Minnesota plans to place the star WR on injured reserve, according to NFL Media and confirmed by CBS Sports Lead NFL Insider Jonathan Jones. The exact timeline is TBD based on how long it takes Jefferson to heal and how he responds to treatment. But he is out at least four games in a crushing blow to the Vikings. Jefferson slipped on the U.S. Bank Stadium turf while running a route against Chiefs cornerback Trent McDuffie late in Kansas City's Week 5 27-20 victory. He was ruled questionable to return and did remain on the sidelines after limping off for medical attention. But he didn't take another snap before the final buzzer, leaving rookie Jordan Addison to serve as Kirk Cousins' top pass target. Head coach Kevin O'Connell made a personal visit to Jefferson's locker on his way to the podium after the game, attempting to console the wideout, who did not speak with reporters. On Monday, O'Connell told reporters that Jefferson would solicit multiple medical opinions on his hamstring. "We've got to get the MRI of it and take a look and find out exactly what it is, where it is, if there's any other factors that go into it and determine what the best decision (is) for him to get him back to 100 percent as fast as possible," O'Connell said. "He's down today. He obviously is one of the most ultra-competitors I've ever met, and shoot, he was trying to go back in the game as it was yesterday. So we're gonna have to medically make a good decision and help kind of almost protect him from himself a little bit." From CBS Sports Fantasy Senior Editor Dan Schneier: With Jefferson out, most Fantasy Football managers will turn their attention to rookie first-round draft pick Jordan Addison as the next man up. While it's possible this is the opportunity Addison needs, he's more likely to be currently rostered than K.J. Osborn, who is actually more likelier to have an edge over the rookie when it comes to future route participation, snap share and built-in rapport with quarterback Kirk Cousins. As mentioned by host Adam Aizer on the Fantasy Football Today podcast earlier this week, Osborn has scored at least 14.6 PPR points in eight of 11 games with at least seven targets, averaging 16.1 points per game in those 11 games. However, in 48 total games with the Vikings, Osborn has only averaged 5.5 targets per game – including the four games that former Vikings WR Adam Thielen was out for. Osborn's target share should take a jump without Jefferson on the field given the fact that Jefferson has averaged 11.75 targets per game in his four full games this year, but he's more of a WR3 while Jefferson is out.  Entering Week 5, Osborn was dead last (69th out of 69 wide receivers) at 0.69 yards per route run minus busted coverages. As for Addison, the rookie's role is likely to grow from a snap share standpoint, and assuming he can do more with his routes than Osborn, his rapport with Cousins could build fast. Addison's upside lands him in the borderline WR2/3 range. Finally, T.J. Hockenson is set to take a jump in targets as well. Hockenson has averaged six targets per game this season – that number could jump as much as 25-50% per game. He's already an every-week starter at TE, but during Jefferson's absence, Hockenson has the opportunity to become more of a weekly difference maker at the position.

            <p class="summary">There are some good bargains to be had during Amazon’s fall Prime Day event. Ecovacs’ newest flagship robot vacuum, the X2 Omni, launched last week and is already $200 off. The best Amazon Alexa smart speaker, thanks to its excellent sound, nice design, and built-in smart home hub, the Echo (fourth-gen) is a great way to get started with the smart home.

            <p class="element-article">By  Jennifer Pattison Tuohy, a smart home reviewer who's been testing connected gadgets since 2013. Previously a writer for Wirecutter, Wired, and BBC Science Focus. If you buy something from a Verge link, Vox Media may earn a commission. See our ethics statement. It’s another Prime Day — or Prime Big Deal Days, in Amazon parlance — which means another day to save a dollar or two on some great new gear for your smart home. Whether you’re looking for a robot helper to clean your floors, an extra set of eyes to watch over your property, or another smart speaker to bark commands at Amazon’s Alexa voice assistant, there are some good bargains to be had during Amazon’s fall Prime Day event. As usual, robot vacuums are seeing some decent sales, including on the top-of-the-line models that don’t see discounts as often as the rest of the bunch. (My advice is to never buy a bot that’s not on sale because they’re always on sale.) Ecovacs’ newest flagship robot vacuum, the X2 Omni, launched last week and is already $200 off. I’ve started testing it, and it’s an impressive machine; its square shape gives it the advantage of getting into corners better than most rounder bots.  The higher-end Ring smart security cameras are also getting deep discounts: the Ring Pro 2 video doorbell and Ring Floodlight Cam Wired Pro add radar motion detection and better video quality over the base models. These are rarely on sale and are seeing up to $100 off. Here’s a roundup of some of the best deals on good products that I’ve spotted so far. I’ll update this throughout the sale event, so check back often.  The Roomba i4 Evo robot vacuum (the Roomba i3 by another name and with a bigger battery) cleans just as well as the flagship Roomba j7 and can map your house for more accurate vacuuming. But there’s no AI-powered obstacle avoidance or virtual keep-out zones, so you do have to clean up your clutter before you run it. The Roborock Q5 Plus is a great robot vacuum that can empty itself and features mapping and virtual keep-out zones with lidar navigation for the bargain price of $399.99. This is one of the few Roborocks you can get without a mop, making it a good choice for homes with lots of carpet. The excellent Ring Pro 2 video doorbell is $100 off — a very good price for a very good doorbell with the best video quality, good connectivity, and superb motion detection. Read my review. The best Amazon Alexa smart speaker, thanks to its excellent sound, nice design, and built-in smart home hub, the Echo (fourth-gen) is a great way to get started with the smart home. Along with being a smart speaker it’s also a Matter controller, Thread border router, and Zigbee bridge, so it can connect all your gadgets to your smart home.  This versatile smart lock is seeing its lowest price. It supports Apple Home Key and has a built-in fingerprint reader plus a touchscreen keypad. It’s Matter-compatible and requires an Aqara Zigbee hub for Matter support. (The Hub M2 is also on sale at $41.99, 30 percent off.) Read my review. The Ecobee Smart Thermostat Premium does a lot. As well as adjusting your HVAC intelligently based on whether you’re home or away and / or where you are in your home, it’s also an indoor air quality monitor, smart speaker (Amazon’s Alexa or Apple’s Siri), and a hub for Ecobee’s smart security system. The excellent Apple Home-compatible Meross Smart Power Strip is down to $32.54 with an on-page coupon. You get four sockets and four USB ports, all controllable through Apple Home, Alexa, and Google Home.  With the MyQ Chamberlain Smart Garage Control, you can open and close your garage door from any location using your smartphone.
